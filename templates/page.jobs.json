Experience in a creative field, personally or professionally, is highly valued and will help convey key aesthetic and design concepts. Most important is a willingness to learn new skills, and a disposition to deliver course content in a clear, patient way to every participant. </p><p>Relevant knowledge and experience with bonsai will influence the timeline and trajectory as a Bonsai Bar team member. An initial appointment as an assistant may be required until a comfort with the course content and skillset is established.</p><p>Our teachers and assistants are comfortable lifting up to 50lbs, open to regional travel, and can work evenings and some weekends. Our schedule can be very flexible to fit most schedules.</p><p>Bonsai Bar provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.</p><p>This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.</p>"
